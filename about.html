<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Eric Bravo and I'm a middle school science teacher with a passion for web development. I earned my
B.S. in Nutritional Science from Rutgers University and later completed the Alternate Route program to obtain my
teaching certification. Currently, I'm taking a web development course through Udemy to enhance my skills in this field.</p>

<p>Before becoming a teacher, I worked as a technician and sales representative for Verizon Wireless. After earning my
degree, I offered nutrition counseling and personal training services at the Robert Wood Johnson Fitness & Wellness
Center. Eventually, I decided to pursue my passion for education and became a middle school science teacher in the
Edison school district where I currently work.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy staying active through fitness, reading, comics, sports, gaming, and cooking. I'm also an avid coder and enjoy
working on web development projects whenever I can. My ultimate goal is to find a part-time job as a web developer while
continuing my teaching career.</p>

<p>As an educator and web developer, I'm passionate about using technology to enhance the learning experience for my
students and to build innovative and user-friendly websites. I'm always looking for ways to grow my skills and
contribute to the tech community.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by and getting to know me a bit better. If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel
free to reach out to me.</p>
